We need to solve the problem to cover all the edge cases aligning with the constraints given in the problem:

(a) When the elements are duplicate more than once and matches the first element others all are unique return the first element
(b) If the element matches with its just adjustment element or two sequence elemets then return that element because that occurs more than once
(c) The last safe edge cases if no elements are found to solve the problem then just return the first element as the output.
